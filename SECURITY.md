# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue related to the FFI API specifications, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it directly to BSAB via:

ðŸ“§ ffisecretariat@bankinfrastruktur.se

We will acknowledge your report within 5 business days and coordinate a responsible resolution.

This repository is read-only, and implementation is governed by formal agreements with BSAB. Still, we take potential weaknesses in documentation or process seriously.
