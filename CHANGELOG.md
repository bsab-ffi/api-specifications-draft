# Changelog – FFI API Specification Repository

This changelog documents updates to the public `ffi` repository, which contains synchronized API specifications from:

- FFI Core API (`core/ffi-core.yaml`)
- FFI Contract API (`contract/ffi-contract.yaml`)
- FFI API Conventions (`conventions/`)

Each repository release is dated (YYYY-MM-DD) and reflects the latest approved changes published by BSAB.

> Note: Individual API specification files follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (e.g., `1.2.0`). The repository itself uses calendar versioning (e.g., `2025-03-15`) to represent public release dates.
